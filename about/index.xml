      <description>#What I Do
I&amp;rsquo;m a technologist comfortable working cross-functionally. I have taken on roles on teams ranging from project management, product management, ops, and (primarily) software engineering with a focus on the backend.
#Achievements
I graduated from Duke in 3 years while completing three different courses of study (Computer Science, Finance, Decision Sciences) and being only a part-time student my final semester.
I&amp;rsquo;ve held engineering positions at high-growth startups, a multinational conglomerate, and at the world&amp;rsquo;s largest hedge fund.</description>
